# Wallet Network Sync Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented wallet network sync detection to prevent payments from being built for the wrong network when users change networks in their wallet extensions after connecting.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Type Updates (`packages/core/src/types/index.ts`)
- Added `walletNetwork` field to `WalletState` interface
- This tracks the actual network state from the wallet extension (separate from provider network)

### 2. Enhanced useWallet Hook (`packages/core/src/hooks/useWallet.ts`)
**New Features:**
- `refreshWalletNetwork()`: Async function to query and refresh the wallet's current network state
- `isNetworkMismatch`: Computed boolean that returns `true` when provider network doesn't match wallet network
- `walletNetwork`: New state field exposing the wallet's actual network

**Implementation Details:**
- Modified `connectFreighter()` to capture and return wallet network during connection
- Added `getFreighterNetwork()` helper that maps network passphrases to network identifiers
- `refreshWalletNetwork()` safely handles errors and won't throw, just sets error state
- `isNetworkMismatch` automatically computes based on `wallet.network` vs `wallet.walletNetwork`

### 3. Payment Protection (`packages/core/src/hooks/useSendPayment.ts`)
**Network Mismatch Check:**
```typescript
if (wallet.walletNetwork && wallet.network !== wallet.walletNetwork) {
  throw new Error(
    `Network mismatch: Provider is on ${wallet.network} but wallet is on ${wallet.walletNetwork}. ` +
    `Switch your wallet to ${wallet.network} or call refreshWalletNetwork() to update.`
  );
}
```

- Prevents transaction submission when networks don't match
- Provides clear error message with actionable guidance
- Only checks if `walletNetwork` is set (backward compatible with existing state)

### 4. Updated Provider Context (`packages/core/src/context/StellarProvider.tsx`)
- Updated DEFAULT_WALLET to include `walletNetwork: null`
- Ensures all new wallet connections start with proper state

### 5. Enhanced Wallet Demo (`packages/demo/app/demo/wallet/page.tsx`)
**New Display Features:**
- Shows both "Provider Network" and "Wallet Network" separately
- Color-coded network status (green for match, red for mismatch)
- Visual "Network mismatch!" warning when networks don't align
- "Refresh Network" button to manually check wallet network state

**Updated Hook Usage:**
```typescript
const {
  connect,
  disconnect,
  connected,
  address,
  connecting,
  error,
  network: walletProviderNetwork,
  walletNetwork,
  refreshWalletNetwork,
  isNetworkMismatch,
} = useWallet();

const { network: providerNetwork } = useNetwork();
```

### 6. Comprehensive Tests

**useWallet.test.tsx** - 6 test suites covering:
- ✅ Wallet network capture on connection
- ✅ Network mismatch detection on connection attempt
- ✅ Manual wallet network refresh
- ✅ Network state updates after refresh
- ✅ No-op when wallet not connected
- ✅ Error handling during refresh
- ✅ `isNetworkMismatch` computation (matching & mismatched cases)
- ✅ State cleanup on disconnect

**useSendPayment.test.tsx** - 5 test suites covering:
- ✅ Error when wallet not connected
- ✅ Error when networks mismatch  
- ✅ Success when networks match
- ✅ Success with null walletNetwork (legacy state)
- ✅ Helpful error messages for network mismatch

**All tests passing:** 28 tests total across 3 test files

## API Changes

### useWallet Hook - New Return Values
```typescript
{
  // Existing fields...
  walletNetwork: StellarNetwork | null;        // NEW: Actual wallet network
  refreshWalletNetwork: () => Promise<void>;   // NEW: Refresh wallet network
  isNetworkMismatch: boolean;                  // NEW: Network mismatch indicator
}
```

### Usage Example
```typescript
const {
  connect,
  walletNetwork,
  refreshWalletNetwork,
  isNetworkMismatch,
} = useWallet();

// Connect wallet
await connect("freighter");

// Later, user might change network in Freighter
// Developer can refresh to detect this
await refreshWalletNetwork();

// Check for mismatch
if (isNetworkMismatch) {
  alert("Please switch your wallet to the correct network!");
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Wallet network state can be refreshed after connection**
- `refreshWalletNetwork()` function implemented and tested

✅ **Mismatched wallet/provider network is visible to developers**
- `isNetworkMismatch` boolean exposed
- `walletNetwork` field shows actual wallet network
- Demo page visually indicates mismatch

✅ **Payment hooks block unsafe submission on network mismatch**
- `useSendPayment` checks network before building transaction
- Clear error message thrown when mismatch detected

✅ **Demo page clearly shows network status**
- Displays both Provider Network and Wallet Network
- Color-coded visual indicators (green/red)
- "Network mismatch!" warning message
- Refresh Network button

✅ **Tests cover mismatch handling**
- 11 tests specifically for network sync features
- Tests cover connection, refresh, mismatch detection, and error scenarios
- Tests verify payment blocking on mismatch

## Technical Notes

### Network Detection Approach
Since Freighter doesn't expose network change events, we implemented:
1. **Capture on connection**: Store wallet network during initial connection
2. **Manual refresh**: `refreshWalletNetwork()` for polling when needed
3. **Automatic validation**: Payment hooks check mismatch before submission

### Backward Compatibility
- `walletNetwork` can be `null` for old state or wallets that don't support detection
- Network mismatch check only runs if `walletNetwork` is populated
- Existing integrations work without changes

### Security
- Prevents cross-network transaction submission
- Clear error messages guide users to fix misconfiguration
- No automatic network switching (user must explicitly fix mismatch)
