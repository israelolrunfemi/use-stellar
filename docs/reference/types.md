# TypeScript Types Reference

Complete reference of every TypeScript type and interface exported by `use-stellar`. All types are organized by category with field-by-field documentation.

## Network Types

### `StellarNetwork`

The Stellar network environment.

```typescript
type StellarNetwork = "testnet" | "mainnet" | "futurenet" | "custom"
```

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"testnet"` | SDF Testnet — use for development and testing |
| `"mainnet"` | Production network — use for real transactions |
| `"futurenet"` | SDF Futurenet — where new protocol features land before testnet |
| `"custom"` | Any other network: a local standalone/quickstart node, or a private deployment. Ships no defaults, so `networkConfig` must supply the endpoints **and** the passphrase. |

### `NetworkConfig`

Configuration details for a specific Stellar network, as resolved by
`StellarProvider`.

```typescript
interface NetworkConfig {
  network: StellarNetwork
  horizonUrl: string
  sorobanUrl: string
  networkPassphrase: string
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `network` | `StellarNetwork` | The network identifier |
| `horizonUrl` | `string` | Horizon API endpoint URL for this network |
| `sorobanUrl` | `string` | Soroban RPC endpoint URL for this network |
| `networkPassphrase` | `string` | The passphrase every transaction is signed against. Mixed into the transaction hash, which is what binds a signature to one network. |

**Example:**
```typescript
const testnetConfig: NetworkConfig = {
  network: "testnet",
  horizonUrl: "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org",
  sorobanUrl: "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org",
  networkPassphrase: "Test SDF Network ; September 2015",
}
```

### `CustomNetworkConfig`

The override accepted by `StellarProvider`'s `networkConfig` prop.

```typescript
interface CustomNetworkConfig {
  horizonUrl: string
  sorobanUrl: string
  networkPassphrase?: string
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `horizonUrl` | `string` | Yes | Horizon API endpoint |
| `sorobanUrl` | `string` | Yes | Soroban RPC endpoint |
| `networkPassphrase` | `string` | Only for `network="custom"` | Optional for `testnet`, `mainnet`, and `futurenet`, whose passphrases are known. Required for `"custom"` — the provider throws at render without it, rather than signing against a guess. |

### `NETWORK_PASSPHRASES`

The passphrase for each network this library ships defaults for.

```typescript
const NETWORK_PASSPHRASES: Record<"testnet" | "mainnet" | "futurenet", string>
```

### `getNetworkPassphrase`

Returns the passphrase for a network, or `undefined` for `"custom"`.

```typescript
function getNetworkPassphrase(network: StellarNetwork): string | undefined
```

Prefer this over indexing `NETWORK_PASSPHRASES` directly: a custom network
genuinely has no known passphrase, and `undefined` says so instead of handing
back the wrong one.

## Wallet Types

### `WalletType`

Supported wallet providers.

```typescript
type WalletType = "freighter" | "lobstr" | "albedo" | "rabet"

}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connected` | `boolean` | Whether a wallet is currently connected |

| `walletName` | `string \| null` | Human-readable name of the connected wallet provider |

**Example:**
```typescript
const state: WalletState = {
  connected: true,
  connecting: false,
